# march-madness

As commissioner of a March Madness bracket you're competing for entries. And although you had 25 people join your bracket last year, 24 of them don't have a great reason to rejoin this year. To solve this problem you must differentiate your bracket from the masses. So, as commissioner of "The Barry Goodman Classic" I send some simple analytics during the tourney to keep the group engaged. Seems to work, and provoke trash talk.

I send two analytics emails to the group during the tournament:

- Once the tournament kicks off
- Post-tournament recap
